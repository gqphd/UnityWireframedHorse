Unity Wireframed Horse
======================

 

Sample project for camera free roaming, and mesh wireframe representation.

 

Open this file in unity editor.

Main scene is /TestScene/sc1.unity

 

You will see two Horses in that scene.

One is normal horse(Unlit textured shader usded) and the other one is wireframed
horse(UCLA Wireframe shader is used with minor modification.).

You can move camera freely with your mouse, and WASD keyboard keys.

... and that is pretty much it.

 

Used open source, and disclaims responsibilites upon using those.

All open-sources were downloaded from Unity Appstore.
