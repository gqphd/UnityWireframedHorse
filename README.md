Sample project for camera free roaming, and mesh wireframe representation.

 

Open this file in unity editor.

You will see two Horses in that scene.

One is normal horse(Unlit textured shader usded) and the other one is wireframed
horse(UCLA Wireframe shader is used with minor modification.).

You can move camera freely with your mouse, and WASD keyboard keys.

... and it is pretty much it.
